The code for PhysRevB.94.195105
==============

Here is the core algorithm implementation from Lei Wang’s article [Phys. Rev. B 94, 195105](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.94.195105), titled “Discovering phase transitions with unsupervised learning”.

The implementation details of the core methods and the corresponding results are provided in [Implementation.md](Implementation.md) and in the generated [Implementation.pdf](Implementation.pdf).
